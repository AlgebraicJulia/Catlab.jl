A data migration is defined by a functor from D to a category of queries on C. Thus, every object of D is assigned a query on C and every morphism of D is assigned a morphism of queries, in a compatible way. Example usages are in the unit tests. What follows is a technical reference.\n\nSeveral categories of queries are supported by this macro:\n\nTrivial queries, specified by a single object of C. In this case, the macro simply defines a functor D  C and is equivalent to @finfunctor or @diagram.\nConjunctive queries, specified by a diagram in C and evaluated as a finite limit.\nGluing queries, specified by a diagram in C and evaluated as a finite colimit. An important special case is linear queries, evaluated as a finite coproduct.\nGluc queries (gluings of conjunctive queries), specified by a diagram of diagrams in C and evaluated as a colimit of limits. An important special case is duc queries (disjoint unions of conjunctive queries), evaluated as a coproduct of limits.\n\nThe query category of the data migration is not specified explicitly but is inferred from the queries used in the macro call. Implicit conversion is performed: trivial queries can be coerced to conjunctive queries or gluing queries, and conjunctive queries and gluing queries can both be coerced to gluc queries. Due to the implicit conversion, the resulting functor out of D has a single query type and thus a well-defined codomain.\n\nSyntax for the right-hand sides of object assignments is:\n\na symbol, giving object of C (query type: trivial)\n@product ...

(alias: @colimit, query type: gluing)\n\nThes query types supported by this macro generalize the kind of queries familiar from relational databases. Less familiar is the concept of a morphism between queries, derived from the concept of a morphism between diagrams in a category. A query morphism is given by a functor between the diagrams' indexing categories together with a natural transformation filling a triangle of the appropriate shape. From a practical standpoint, the most important thing to remember is that a morphism between conjunctive queries is contravariant with respect to the diagram shapes, whereas a morphism between gluing queries is covariant.

In the graphs section of this documentation, you can find a description of bipartite and k-partite graphs as a morphisms into a clique. That definition is very mathematically pleasing because it gives you a category of partitioned graphs that are derived from commuting triangles in Graph. However, for application oriented practitioners, the definition of a bipartite graph as \"a graph with two sets of vertices, where all the edges go between the groups with no edges within either group\" is probably more explicit. For example a classic way to get a bipartite graph would be to look at the graph of authors and papers that those authors wrote. People write papers, people do not write people and papers do not write papers so the authorship graph is bipartite. These two equivalent definitions of a bipartite graph are related via an isomorphism you can find on the nlab. It shows that a slice category of [C,Set]/X is isomorphic to [El(X), Set] which is a cateogory of presheaves on a different schema. Catlab knows how to use this idea to turn a category of elements into a schema for a new category of presheaves.

This cone structure can be queried using the functions apex and legs. Julia's multiple dispatch feature is heavily used to specialize limit and colimit computations for various diagram shapes like product/coproduct and equalizer/coequalizer. As a consumer of this API, it is highly recommended that you use multiple dispatch to specialize your code on the diagram shape whenever possible.","category":"page"},{"location":"apis/categorical_algebra/","page":"Categorical algebra","title":"Categorical algebra","text":"Modules = [\n  CategoricalAlgebra.FreeDiagrams,\n  CategoricalAlgebra.Limits,\n  ]\nPrivate = false","category":"page"},{"location":"apis/categorical_algebra/#Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra.FreeDiagrams","page":"Categorical algebra","title":"Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra.FreeDiagrams","text":"Free diagrams in a category.\n\nA free diagram in a category is a diagram whose shape is a free category.

The cartesian product acts on functions in a similar way, f×g is the function that takes a tuple (x:dom(f),y:dom(g)) and applies them in parallel and returns (f(x), g(y)):(codom(f)×codom(g)). The axioms of an SMC require that these two operations work together. The Seven Sketches book suppresses an interesting axiom called the interchange law for brevity, but it is worth calling some attention to it. In order for the sequential and parallel composition operators to capture our intuition, we need to assert that for any functions with compatible domains we can interchange parallel and sequential operators. Formally, ((f ⊗ g) ⋅ (h ⊗ k) == (f ⋅ h) ⊗ (g ⋅ k) where (A::Ob, B::Ob, C::Ob, X::Ob, Y::Ob, Z::Ob, f::(A → B), h::(B → C), g::(X → Y), k::(Y → Z))). This axiom says that doing f and g in parallel and then h and k in parallel is the same as doing (f then h) and (g then k) in parallel. When using SMCs to model processes, this axiom is critical to making sure that scheduling those processes is coherent.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/sketches/smc/","page":"Symmetric Monoidal Categories","title":"Symmetric Monoidal Categories","text":"If the SMC is not strict, then the equations are replaced by natural isomorphisms.
