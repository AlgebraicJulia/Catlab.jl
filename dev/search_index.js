A data migration is defined by a functor from D to a category of queries on C. Thus, every object of D is assigned a query on C and every morphism of D is assigned a morphism of queries, in a compatible way. Example usages are in the unit tests and the AlgebraicJulia blog (TODO: link). What follows is a technical reference.\n\nSeveral categories of queries are supported by this macro:\n\nTrivial queries, specified by a single object of C. In this case, the macro simply defines a functor D  C and is equivalent to @finfunctor or @diagram.\nConjunctive queries, specified by a diagram in C and evaluated as a finite limit.\nGluing queries, specified by a diagram in C and evaluated as a finite colimit. An important special case is linear queries, evaluated as a finite coproduct.\nGluc queries (gluings of conjunctive queries), specified by a diagram of diagrams in C and evaluated as a colimit of limits. An important special case is duc queries (disjoint unions of conjunctive queries), evaluated as a coproduct of limits.\n\nThe query category of the data migration is not specified explicitly but is inferred from the queries used in the macro call. Implicit conversion is performed: trivial queries can be coerced to conjunctive queries or gluing queries, and conjunctive queries and gluing queries can both be coerced to gluc queries. Due to the implicit conversion, the resulting functor out of D has a single query type and thus a well-defined codomain.\n\nSyntax for the right-hand sides of object assignments is:\n\na symbol, giving object of C (query type: trivial)\n@product ... (query type: conjunctive)\n@join ... (alias: @limit, query type: conjunctive)\n@cases ... (alias: @coproduct, query type: gluing or gluc)\n@glue ... (alias: @colimit, query type: gluing or gluc)\n\nThes query types supported by this macro generalize the kind of queries familiar from relational databases. Less familiar is the concept of a morphism between queries, derived from the concept of a morphism between diagrams in a category. A query morphism is given by a functor between the diagrams' indexing categories together with a natural transformation filling a triangle of the appropriate shape. From a practical standpoint, the most important thing to remember is that a morphism between conjunctive queries is contravariant with respect to the diagram shapes, whereas a morphism between gluing queries is covariant.

In an essentially algebraic theory, you can have partially defined operations; however, to maintain the equational character of the system, the domains of operations must themselves be defined equationally. For example, the theory of categories would be defined as having two types, Ob and Hom, and the composition operation compose(f::Hom,g::Hom)::Hom would have domain given by the equation codom(f) == dom(g).

For example in Set, you compose two functions f⋅g by first applying f and then applying g. In monoidal categories, you also have the parallel composition ⊗ which you can think of as representing the simultaneous exectution of two processes. We are familiar with the cartesian product in Set which takes two sets and forms the cartesian product. The cartesian product acts on functions in a similar way, f×g is the function that takes a tuple (x:dom(f),y:dom(g)) and applies them in parallel and returns (f(x), g(y)):(codom(f)×codom(g)). The axioms of an SMC require that these two operations work together. The Seven Sketches book suppresses an interesting axiom called the interchange law for brevity, but it is worth calling some attention to it. In order for the sequential and parallel composition operators to capture our intuition, we need to assert that for any functions with compatible domains we can interchange parallel and sequential operators. Formally, ((f ⊗ g) ⋅ (h ⊗ k) == (f ⋅ h) ⊗ (g ⋅ k) where (A::Ob, B::Ob, C::Ob, X::Ob, Y::Ob, Z::Ob, f::(A → B), h::(B → C), g::(X → Y), k::(Y → Z))).
