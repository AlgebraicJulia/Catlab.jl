    "\n",
    "This vignette supports section 4.4.3 of Seven Sketches in Compositionality, which introduces the definition of symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). SMCs are a core concept in applied category theory and are a workhorse of Catlab's utility in computing applications. We will discuss the definition as a GAT, see examples of working with formulas, and conversions to wiring diagrams (sometimes called string diagrams). SMCs are useful for modeling mathematical structures like programs or processes where the objects represent data or things and the morphisms represent processes that happen to those things."

    "Let 𝒞 be a category, then a strict symmetric monoidal structure on 𝒞 has as data:\n",
    "1. An object I called the monoidal unit\n",
    "2. A functor ⊗: 𝒞×𝒞 → 𝒞 called the monoidal product.\n",
    "3. A natural isomorphism σᵃᵇ: A⊗B → B⊗A\n",

    "It has as axioms:\n",
    "1. Left identity) I⊗C = C for all objects C in 𝒞\n",
    "2. Right identity) C⊗I = C for all objects C in 𝒞\n",
    "3. Associativity) (A⊗B)⊗C = A⊗(B⊗C) for all objects A,B,C in 𝒞\n",
    "4. Involutivity) σ(σ(A,B)) = id(A⊗B)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a category, you have a composition operation that captures the sequential kind of composition. For example in Set, you compose two functions f⋅g by first applying f and then applying g. In monoidal categories, you also have the parallel composition ⊗ which you can think of as representing the simultaneous exectution of two processes. We are familiar with the cartesian product in Set which takes two sets and forms the cartesian product. The cartesian product acts on functions in a similar way, f×g is the function that takes a tuple (x:dom(f),y:dom(g)) and applies them *in parallel* and returns (f(x), g(y)):(codom(f)×codom(g)). The axioms of an SMC require that these two operations work together. The Seven Sketches book suppresses an interesting axiom called the *interchange law* for brevity, but it is worth calling some attention to it. In order for the sequential and parallel composition operators to capture our intuition, we need to assert that for any functions with compatible domains we can interchange parallel and sequential operators. Formally, ((f ⊗ g) ⋅ (h ⊗ k) == (f ⋅ h) ⊗ (g ⋅ k) where (A::Ob, B::Ob, C::Ob, X::Ob, Y::Ob, Z::Ob, f::(A → B), h::(B → C), g::(X → Y), k::(Y → Z))). This axiom says that doing f and g in parallel and then h and k in parallel is the same as doing (f then h) and (g then k) in parallel. When using SMCs to model processes, this axiom is critical to making sure that scheduling those processes is coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the SMC is not strict, then the equations are replaced by natural isomorphisms. The choice of natural isomorphisms then becomes part of the data of the SMC. With MacLane's coherence theorem for SMCs mathematicians can think about strict SMCs and not really worry too much about the natural isomorphisms. As programmers, those chickens come home to roost and implementing an SMC requires making some choices about about how to do that strictification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Catlab definitions of SMC are repeated here for convenience. Catlab allows you to implement mathematical definitions in the language of Generalized Algebraic Theories (GATs), which are a good fit for the kind of natural language definitions that mathematicians will write. Because Catlab does relatively little type inference, the GAT version of a definition can be more verbose than you would get in natural language. For example, we have to be careful about spelling out the object for an identity morphism `id(A):A → A`. The notation  `@theory MonoidalCategory{Ob,Hom} <: Category{Ob,Hom}` says that a Monoidal Category is a type of Category with additional components and axioms. Catlab has only rudimentary support for Monoidal Categories that are not Symmetric Monoidal Categories. But we separate out the definitions for completeness.\n",

Catlab calls the swap morphism a braid, because that is how you visualize it in wiring diagrams, but we stick with the conventional σ unicode name. The macro `@op` tells Catlab that you want to use a unicode operator as an alias for you term constructor. If you are familiar with type theory, you might be wondering why we write the context after the terms.
