            **Style**

            - [ ] Indent width is 2 spaces
            - [ ] Avoid lines longer than 80 characters
            - [ ] No functions (&gt;= 3) contain overlapping arguments that are common aspects of a shared concept
            - [ ] Code is properly split into modules that maximizes isolation of features

            **Tests**

            - [ ] New features have accompanying unit tests
            - [ ] Bug fixes have unit tests exposing the bug
            - [ ] No deletion of unit tests unless explicitly documented in pull request
            - [ ] New modules have tests and are ultimately called by the test runner (`test/runtests.jl`)
            - [ ] Code coverage &gt;= 90%, test coverage reduction must be documented in pull request

            **Documentation**

            - [ ] All exported functions, types, and constants have docstrings
            - [ ] Docstrings are written in complete sentences with appropriate capitalization and punctuation
            - [ ] Citations are provided for constructions and algorithms implemented/inspired from external sources
