# Contributing to Catlab

We welcome contributions to Catlab, regardless of your experience level with
category theory or the Julia language. Contributions should be made through pull
requests (PR) on GitHub.

The GitHub wiki has
[guidelines](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl/wiki/Guidelines-for-PR-writers-and-reviewers)
for writers and reviewers of PRs. Newcomers should not be alarmed by this list;
it is the role of Catlab's core developers to review PRs and help you understand
our conventions.
