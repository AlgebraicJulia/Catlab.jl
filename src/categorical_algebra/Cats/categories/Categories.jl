""" Size of a category, used for dispatch and subtyping purposes.

A [`Category`](@ref) type having a particular `CatSize` means that categories of
that type are *at most* that large.
"""

""" Size of a large category, such as Set.

To the extent that they form a category, we regard Julia types and functions
([`TypeCat`](@ref)) as forming a large category.
"""

""" Abstract base type for a category.

The objects and morphisms in the category have Julia types `Ob` and `Hom`,
respectively. Note that these types do *not* necessarily form an `@instance` of
the theory of categories, as they may not meaningfully form a category outside
the context of this object. For example, a finite category regarded as a
reflexive graph with a composition operation might have type `Cat{Int,Int}`,
where the objects and morphisms are numerical identifiers for vertices and edges
in the graph.

The basic operations available in any category are: [`dom`](@ref),
[`codom`](@ref), [`id`](@ref), [`compose`](@ref).

Converts the input to an object in the category, which should be of type `Ob` in
a category of type `Cat{Ob,Hom}`. How this works depends on the category, but a
common case is to look up objects, which might be integers or GAT expressions,
by their human-readable name, usually a symbol.
