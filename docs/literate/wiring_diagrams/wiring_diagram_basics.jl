# Using Catlab, you can create, manipulate, serialize, and visualize *wiring
# diagrams*, also known as [string
# diagrams](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+diagram). The flexible data
# structure for wiring diagrams allows arbitrary data to be attached to boxes,
# ports, and wires, and supports recursively nested diagrams.
# 
# You can interact with wiring diagrams using two different progamming
# interfaces:
# 
# 1. **Categorical**: A high-level, functional interface expressed in terms of
#    categorical concepts, such as composition (`compose`), monoidal products
#    (`otimes`), duplication (`mcopy`), and deletion (`delete`).
# 
# 2. **Imperative**: A lower-level, mutating interface to directly manipulate
#    boxes, ports, and wires, via operations like adding boxes (`add_box`) and
#    wires (`add_wire`).
# 
# In this notebook, we introduce both interfaces. We do not explicitly cover the
# visualization API, although for illustrative purposes we will draw wiring
# diagrams using Graphviz. Thus, you should install
# [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) if you wish to run this notebook.

# ## Data structures
# 
# The basic building blocks of a wiring diagram are boxes, ports, and wires. The
# top-level data structure is `WiringDiagram`, defined in the module
# `Catlab.WiringDiagrams`. A wiring diagram consists of boxes (usually of type
# `Box`) connected by wires (of type `Wire`). Each box has a sequence of input
# ports and a sequence of output ports, as does the wiring diagram itself. The
# wires have sources and targets, both of which consist of a box and a port on
# that box.
# 
# The boxes in a wiring diagram are indexed by integer IDs. Boxes can be
# retrieved by ID, and wires refer to boxes using their IDs. Two special IDs,
# obtained by `input_id` and `output_id` methods, refer to the inputs and
# outputs of the diagram itself. In this way, wires can connect the (inner)
# boxes of a diagram to the diagram's "outer box".
# 
# The `WiringDiagram` data structure is an elaborate wrapper around a directed
# graph from [LightGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl).
# The underlying `DiGraph` object can be accessed using the `graph` method. The
# vertices of this graph are exactly the box IDs. The graph should never be
# mutated directly, on pain of creating inconsistent state, but it does allow
# convenient access to the large array of [graph
# algorithms](https://juliagraphs.github.io/LightGraphs.jl/latest/) supported by
# LightGraphs.
# 
# All this is somewhat abstract but should become clearer as we see concrete 
# examples.

# ## Categorical interface
#
# In this example, the wiring diagrams will carry symbolic expressions (of type
# `Catlab.ObExpr` and `Catlab.HomExpr`).

using Catlab.Doctrines

A, B, C, D = Ob(FreeBiproductCategory, :A, :B, :C, :D)
f = Hom(:f, A, B)
g = Hom(:g, B, C)
h = Hom(:h, C, D)

f

# ### Generators
#
# Convert each of the morphism generators into a diagram with a single box.

f, g, h = to_wiring_diagram(f), to_wiring_diagram(g), to_wiring_diagram(h)
f
#-
show_diagram(f)

# ### Composition

compose(f,g)
#-
show_diagram(compose(f,g))

# ### Monoidal products

otimes(f,h)
#-
show_diagram(otimes(f,h))

# ### Copy and merge, delete and create

mcopy(codom(f),2)
#-
show_diagram(mcopy(codom(f),2))
#-
show_diagram(compose(f, mcopy(codom(f),2)))
#-
show_diagram(compose(mcopy(dom(f),2), otimes(f,f)))

# ## Imperative interface
#
# We now show how to manipulate wiring diagrams using the low-level, imperative
# interface. The diagrams will carry Julia symbols.

f = Box(:f, [:A], [:B])
g = Box(:g, [:B], [:C])
h = Box(:h, [:C], [:D])

f

# ### Composition
#
# For example, here is how to manually construct a composition of two boxes.
#
# The `add_box!` method adds a box to a wiring diagrams and returns the ID
# assigned to the box. How the boxes are indexed is an implementation detail
# that you should not rely on; use the IDs that the system gives you.

d = WiringDiagram([:A], [:C])

fv = add_box!(d, f)
gv = add_box!(d, g)

add_wires!(d, [
  (input_id(d),1) => (fv,1),
  (fv,1) => (gv,1),
  (gv,1) => (output_id(d),1),
])

nboxes(d)
#-
nwires(d)
#-
d
#-
show_diagram(d)

# ### Products
#
# Here is how to manually construct a product of two boxes.

d = WiringDiagram([:A,:C], [:B,:D])

fv = add_box!(d, f)
hv = add_box!(d, h)

add_wires!(d, [
  (input_id(d),1) => (fv,1),
  (input_id(d),2) => (hv,1),
  (fv,1) => (output_id(d),1),
  (hv,1) => (output_id(d),2),
])
